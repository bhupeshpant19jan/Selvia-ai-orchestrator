Initializing n8n process
Deprecation warning: The storage directory "/home/bhpant/.n8n/binaryData" will be renamed to "/home/bhpant/.n8n/storage" in n8n v3. To migrate now, set N8N_MIGRATE_FS_STORAGE_PATH=true. If you have a volume mounted at the old path, update your mount configuration after migration.
n8n's port 5678 is already in use. Do you have another instance of n8n running already?
